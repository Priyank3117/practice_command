1)what is the testNg
--testng is testing framework for java
--can be used for unit testing, end-to-end testing, integration and functional testing

 
2)-->What is the testng xml file
-- testng file is allow us to write tests in specific manner from any classes we want (can add tests from different class)

3)-->structure of the testng xml file

suites -> test -> classes -> class -> methods --> include

<suite name="Suite1" verbose="1" >

  <test name="Nopackage" >
    <classes>
       <class name="NoPackageTest" />
    </classes>
  </test>

  <test name="Regression1">
    <classes>
      <class name="test.sample.ParameterSample"/>
      <class name="test.sample.ParameterTest"/>
    </classes>
  </test>

</suite>

4) Hard assertion and soft assertion

--> Hard Assertion is provided by --> org.testng.Assert;

--> In the Hard assertion if the condition fail the assertion will throw error immidiately and 
--- the execution flow will be stop further test will not execute

--> Hard assertion method are declare static so you can use directly without making its object

syntax -->   String dashBoardTextValue = dashBoardText.getText();
             String expectedText = "Welcome to SolvSafety";
             Assert.assertEquals(dashBoardTextValue, expectedText);

-----------Soft Assertion

--> In the soft assertion provided by -->org.testng.Assert;

--> Soft asserts are the asserts which continue the execution even after the Assert condition fails.

--> it is used using below syntax

----------------Creating Instance for Soft Assert:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
softAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert();
------------------------------------------------------
In the end, we have to call the assertAll() method that is used to throw the exceptions and results at the end of the test.

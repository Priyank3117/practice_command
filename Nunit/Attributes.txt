[Parallelizable(ParallelScope.Self)]

Attribute Name: [Parallelizable]
Enum Value: ParallelScope.Self

--The [Parallelizable(ParallelScope.Self)] attribute tells NUnit that 
--the test class or test method it is applied to can be executed in parallel with other tests

On Test Classes: When applied to a test class, it allows all methods within 
                 that class to be run in parallel with other classes that have the same ParallelScope.
                Self attribute. It does not affect the parallelism of tests in other classes or in different 
                 assemblies.

On Test Methods: When applied directly to a test method, it allows that specific 
                 test method to be run in parallel with other methods marked with the same 
                 ParallelScope.Self attribute within the same class.

Key Points
------------------------
Isolation: Ensure that tests do not share state or resources that 
           could lead to conflicts when run in parallel.

Performance: Using parallel execution can improve test suite performance
             but may require careful management of shared resources and 
             dependencies.

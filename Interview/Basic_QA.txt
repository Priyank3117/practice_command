1) What is the software testing ? why it is required
--> software testing is the process to evalute or analyze quality, functionality, and performance of the software
--> In software testing we test the functional and non functional part of the software

--> why -- The software testing is required to ensure the quality of the software
        -- Through the testing we can deliverd the bug or error free software to the client   ---> Two testing method can also mentioned in this



2)Explain the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

--> The software testing life cycle is process which is followed by the qa team while testing the software

=====================================
--> STLC process include 
-----------------------------------------
1)Requirement analysis
collabrate with --> stakeholders and clients --> understand --> requirement

2)Test planning
According to the acceptance criteria --> write user story --> based on user story creation of test plan

3)Test case devlopment
--> On the basis of the test plan --> creation of the test cases --> after creating test case verify by the senior

4)Environment setup
--> once the test cases are final --> do the set up of environment for testing

5)Test case execution
--> after environment setup -->  Test Execution

6)Test clouser

=====================
purpose = example
=======================

3) What is the purpose of test data? How do you create an effective test data set?

--> Generally In developing stage --> no actual data available for testing purpose --> example of login --> differnt username and password would be needed
--> developer will be created the data

--> The purpose of the test data is to ensure the testing of the application behaviour with differnt kind of data

--> effecative test data set
--------------------------------------
1) data relevancy --> should be relevant --> represent the real world scenario --> 
 2) diversity 3) completeness 4) security 5) independence


4)What is shift left testing? How different is it from shift right testing?

--> Shift left testing --> By testing early and often we can get identify number of bugs early that could be elimate at staring stage and will not cause big defect in the application

--> On the other hand, shift right testing, also known as testing in production, focuses on conducting testing activities after the development process.
--> It involves gathering insights from real user feedback and interactions after the software has been deployed. Developers
--> then use those insights to improve software quality and come up with new feature ideas.

5)Explain the difference between functional testing and non-functional testing.

6)What is the purpose of test cases and test scenarios?
--> what is test case and what is test scenarios

--> Test scenarios --> It represent the broader concept of real world situation 
                   --> we test the software in the differnt situation and all possible ways that can happen

--> Test case --> Test case is a specific set of conditions that are executed to validate a 
                 particular aspect of the software functionality.

--> Give example of the login

7)What is a defect, and how do you report it effectively?
--> A defect is flaw in the software that cause

1) What is the software testing ? why it is required
--> software testing is the process to evalute or analyze quality, functionality, and performance of the software
--> In software testing we test the functional and non functional part of the software

--> why -- The software testing is required to ensure the quality of the software
        -- Through the testing we can deliverd the bug or error free software to the client ---> Two testing method can also mentioned in this



2)Explain the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

--> The software testing life cycle is process which is followed by the qa team while testing the software

=====================================
--> STLC process include 
-----------------------------------------
1)Requirement analysis
collabrate with --> stakeholders and clients --> understand --> requirement

2)Test planning
According to the acceptance criteria --> write user story --> based on user story creation of test plan

3)Test case devlopment
--> On the basis of the test plan --> creation of the test cases --> after creating test case verify by the senior

4)Environment setup
--> once the test cases are final --> do the set up of environment for testing

5)Test case execution
--> after environment setup -->  Test Execution

6)Test clouser

=====================
purpose = example
=======================

3) What is the purpose of test data? How do you create an effective test data set?

--> Generally In developing stage --> no actual data available for testing purpose --> example of login --> differnt username and password would be needed
--> developer will be created the data

--> The purpose of the test data is to ensure the testing of the application behaviour with differnt kind of data

--> effecative test data set
--------------------------------------
1) data relevancy --> should be relevant --> represent the real world scenario --> 
 2) diversity 3) completeness 4) security 5) independence


4)What is shift left testing? How different is it from shift right testing?

--> Shift left testing --> By testing early and often we can get identify number of bugs early that could be elimate at staring stage and will not cause big defect in the application

--> On the other hand, shift right testing, also known as testing in production, focuses on conducting testing activities after the development process.
--> It involves gathering insights from real user feedback and interactions after the software has been deployed. Developers
--> then use those insights to improve software quality and come up with new feature ideas.

5)Explain the difference between functional testing and non-functional testing.
--> site https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/software-testing-interview-questions

6)What is the purpose of test cases and test scenarios?
--> what is test case and what is test scenarios

--> Test scenarios --> It represent the broader concept of real world situation 
                   --> we test the software in the differnt situation and all possible ways that can happen

--> Test case --> Test case is a specific set of conditions that are executed to validate a 
                 particular aspect of the software functionality.

--> Give example of the login

7)What is a defect, and how do you report it effectively?
--> A defect is flaw in the software that cause unintended behaviour of software
--> It also called bug
--> Try to reproduce the bug and mention the steps for it so developer can easily underastnad and time can be saved in what exactly creating bug
--> Use defect tracking tool like Jira, Bugzilla, or GitHub Issues to better manage the defect
--> Write a high specific description that includes all relevant information about the bug 
--> apply ss if needed

8)Explain the Bug Life Cycle  -> you tube and site

9)What is the difference between manual testing and automated testing?

1) Requirement
-----------
Manual --> Manual testing is used for the testing software using human resource
Automantion -> automation testing is done using automated software testing tool such as selenium and playwright 

2)Accuracy
-------------------
Manual --> Manual testing is less accurate as it intervend by human , but it is very helpful for the understanding and testing complex part of software
Automation --> In the automation testing is more accurate as it is done by machine --> very useful for test task in repeatedly and faster way

3)Speed
------------------
Manual --> Manual is quite slow and automation is very speedy process for testing the software

4)Cost Efficiency
-----------------------------
manual --> Cost-effective for more complex tests that involve some kind of investigation or judgment , or tests which is very unique that you will not run very often.
Automation --> Cost-effective for predictable tests that you will repeat many times across multiple test cycles, especially regression tests.

5)Test Coverage
----------------
Manual ->Covers a wide range of test scenarios, including tests that need human intervention. 
Automation ->Covers a wider range of scenarios, such as large, complex, and repetitive ones. Yet, it is not suited for instances that need human intuition and judgment.

6)reliability
----------------- 
Manual --> More reliable for performing exploratory testing and for identifying  issues or inconsistencies.
Automation --> More reliable for repetitive tests.


10) Define the term "test plan" and describe its components.
--> Test Plan is detail guide for testing the software
--> It tells us how we'll test, what we'll test, and when we will test
--> The plan cover everything about the testing like goals, resource and possible risks
--> component --> https://www.browserstack.com/test-management/features/test-run-management/what-is-test-plan

11) What is the regression testing and why automated testing is recommended for regression testing
--> regression testing is type of software testing that is conducted after the code is update
--> to ensure that new update not introduced any bug in software
--> It involves repeatedly testing the same core features of the application, making the task repetitive by nature. 

--> As software evolves number of feature in increase --> num of regression test increase --> this repetative task done easily by the automation script

12) Explain the Test Pyramid

--> Test pyramid is part of test strategy

--> that represent the distribution of the tests based on the complexity and scope

--> Unit test --> base
--> api test and integration test --> middle
--> ui test --> on top


13)What is exploratory testing? Is it different from ad-hoc testing?
-->Exploratory testing is an unscripted, manual software testing type where testers examine the system with no pre-established test cases and 
--no previous exposure to the system. Instead of following a strict test plan, they jump straight to testing and make spontaneous decisions
 about what to test on the fly. 


14)How to test third-party integrations?
-->Explain user acceptance testing (UAT).

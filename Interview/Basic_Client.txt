1) Intro
-------------------
Iâ€™m Priyank Patel, a Software Testing professional with 3 years of experience in both manual and automation testing. 
I have tested web, desktop, and mobile applications, mainly in the e-commerce and healthcare fields.
 
In manual testing, I focus on every detail to ensure thorough testing.
I am comfortable using IDEs like Visual Studio and Eclipse, and I have hands-on experience with automation tools like Playwright and Selenium  for test scripts.
 
I also have a strong background in creating various types of documentation, such as test cases, test scenarios, test plans, bug reports, and execution reports.
 
As far as the test management tool is concerned I have used Jira, Azure, and TFS as per the client's preference.
